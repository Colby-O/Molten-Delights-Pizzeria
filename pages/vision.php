          <h3>About Molten Delights Pizzeria: Our Vision and Mission</h3>
          <p>
            Molten Delights Pizzeria is a new business, and this is how it
            got started. In the process of traveling the world, we and some
            of our friends had come across many pizzerias, and tasted many 
            delicious dishes. In the process of our travels we somehow got 
            the idea that bring these great dishes back home and make them 
            available to others might be a good idea and even, we hoped, a 
            good business model.
          </p>

          <p>
            Of course it is well known that every one has different taste buds.
            Thus we cannot expect that everything we serve on the menu that we find 
            delicious will excite the same level of admiration in others. However,
            we think that each dish on the menu is "objectively delicious" at 
            some level, and we hope that you will agree.
